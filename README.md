# MapManager
MapManager is a tool for keeping your `garrysmod/downloads/maps/` directory in sync with a server's listing.
## Features
* Download new maps and new versions of maps
* Remove old versions of maps and maps removed from the server's listing

## Todo
* Currently the code is optimised for the Sunrust ZS server. It should be easy to generalize it to other servers but they could use different naming conventions etc..
* Proper exception handling.
* Better CLI.
* An easy way to launch it for those who fear commandline.
* Rewrite the entire thing to Haskell because why not
